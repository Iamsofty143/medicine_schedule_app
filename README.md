About the Project

The Medicine Schedule App is designed to help doctors manage their patients' medicine schedules efficiently. Each patient can have multiple medicine schedules associated with them, specifying details like the time, dose, and number of pills for each medicine.

The primary functionality of the app is to send email notifications to patients 15 minutes before their scheduled medicine time, ensuring they never miss a dose.

This project was created for assignment purposes, aiming to demonstrate proficiency in various technologies and integration techniques.
